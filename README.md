# CT-Covid19-Detector
Project of the Digital System course during the master's degree in Computer Engineering.</br>
The aims of this project were:</br>
- Definition and training of a neural network for the recognition of the COVID-19 disease in CT images</br>
- Development of an application that can be run on Android smartphones and tablets for the use of the neural network</br>

All the details can be found in "Progetto_Manfreda_Andrini.pdf"

## Used technologies
The technologies used are various: the Keras library for the definition of the neural network and its training, TensorFlow Lite for the export of this network in the mobile environment and Android Studio for the development of an app for smartphones and tablets.
